                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Founded in 1990, Chai-Wala began as a humble street-side tea stall with a vision to serve the perfect cup of chai. Our journey started when our founder, inspired by the rich tradition of Indian tea culture, decided to bring authentic chai experiences to modern tea lovers.

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    We source our tea leaves from the finest estates in Assam and Darjeeling. Each cup is crafted with precision, following age-old recipes that have been passed down through generations. Our signature masala chai blend combines premium black tea with hand-ground spices.
